# Getting Started

Singularity Registry provides an automated wahy to build containers from version
controlled recipes in GitHub. Here's how that works.

 1. [Connect](connect) with GitHub to enable collections to build
 2. [Recipes](recipes) should be named according to tags
 3. [Build](../builds) your recipes via commit, manual, or GitHub deployment
 4. [Interact](naming) with your containers via the Singularity software.

And don't forget to read about [server limits](../regulatory/limits) to govern the above.
