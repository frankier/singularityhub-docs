# Limits

Singularity Hub is a build service provided without charge, and so we strongly recommend that you use it responsibly. Please see our [terms](usage-agreement) for usage. This section will be fully released when Singularity Hub goes online. Previous limits are detailed below.

## Building Limits

### Collection Build Queue

For each collection, we allow one active build at a time, and a limit of 5 builds you can have in the active and pending queue at a time. If you ever are concerned about a time out or want to try "pinging" your queue, you can click the ["refresh" icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Refresh_font_awesome.svg/512px-Refresh_font_awesome.svg.png) in the container controls. 

### Time Limit

Your builder has a two hour build limit. After 2 hours, the build will be killed.
